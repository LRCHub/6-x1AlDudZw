[00:00.59] My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
[00:05.88] Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
[00:10.46] And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
[00:34.96] 
[00:19.84] You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
[00:24.94] Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
[00:30.24] And I will block out these voices of reason in my head
[00:57.24] 
[00:38.77] And the voices say, "You are not the exception
[00:45.45] You will never learn your lesson"
[01:01.95] 
[00:50.39] Foolish one
[00:52.18] Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
[00:56.93] That ain't never gonna come
[01:00.16] You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
[01:29.66] 
[01:09.40] You know how to keep me waiting, I know how to act like I'm fine
[01:14.48] Don't know what to call this situation, but I know I can't call you mine
[01:19.58] And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
[01:49.58] 
[01:28.91] 'Cause when my head is on your shoulder, it starts thinking you'll come around
[01:34.27] And maybe someday when we're older, this is something we'll laugh about
[01:39.30] Over coffee every morning while you're watching the news
[02:07.30] 
[01:47.65] But then the voices say, "You are not the exception
[01:54.65] You will never learn your lesson"
[02:11.15] 
[01:59.55] Foolish one
[02:01.37] Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
[02:06.17] That ain't never gonna come
[02:09.44] You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
[02:38.94] 
[02:16.97] Foolish one
[02:18.88] Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
[02:23.58] That ain't never gonna come
[02:26.94] You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
[02:54.44] 
[02:36.13] Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
[02:40.88] Sayin', "How could I not see the signs?"
[02:45.26] Oh, you haven't written me or called
[02:48.32] But goodbye screamin' in the silence
[02:51.17] And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
[03:13.17] 
[02:58.82] 'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
[03:03.66] I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
[03:08.50] And you will say you had the best of intentions
[03:32.00] 
[03:18.47] And maybe I will finally learn my lesson
[03:38.47] 
[03:23.73] Foolish one
[03:25.56] Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
[03:30.36] That ain't never gonna come
[03:33.51] You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
[04:03.01] 
[03:41.09] Foolish one
[03:42.83] Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
[03:47.52] That ain't never gonna come
[03:50.98] You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
[04:18.48] 
[03:58.52] Oh-oh, oh, oh
[04:00.93] La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
[04:05.84] La-la-la-la-la, ain't never gonna come
[04:10.83] Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
[04:28.83] 
[04:20.49] Foolish one
[04:23.19] Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
[04:27.19] They ain't never gonna come
[04:30.27] And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
[04:58.77] 
[04:40.26] Foolish one
[04:42.53] The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
[04:47.65] When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
[04:54.65] No, he just wasn't the one
